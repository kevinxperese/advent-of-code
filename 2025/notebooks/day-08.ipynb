    "# --- Day 8: Playground ---\n",
    "https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/8\n",
    "\n",
    "In my [first crack at this problem](https://github.com/kevinxperese/advent-of-code/blob/3851eb1dca84d1aea829af566bab014cbf62a86b/2025/notebooks/day-08.ipynb), I solved Part 1 without really knowing what I was doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started off with reading in all the 3D coordinates for each box as `numpy` arrays, so I could \"easily\"/efficiently(?) calculate the Euclidean distances between each of them using `np.linalg.norm()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I knew that I would use `itertools.combinations()` to get all the possible pairs between the boxes and I had what I thought was a pretty slow approach by sorting them all by their distances. I then turned to `scipy.spacial.distances.pdist()` to measure all the distances and then used `numpy.triu_indices` to map those back to pairs of boxes, **and** used a prioirty queue (`heapq`) to skip the sorting. This all felt like too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I had those pairs sorted by distances, my `make_circuts()` function was where the real problem was. I was using `itertools.combinations()` again to create new circuts in place. I did piece together on my own that I needed to use `set()` objects and test for intersections and create unions to build up the circuts, like the problem specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I was able to solve Part 1 with this approach, I wasn't able to figure out how to get a solution to Part 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I spent some time (days) thinking about this and reading about approaches."

    "## Key Insight\n",
    "The key insight to solving this problem efficiently is realizing that it's a *graph* problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically: Each box is a *node*/*vertice* and the distance between each is the *weight* for each *edge*. As such, the graph is *fully connected.* (Each node is connect to all the other nodes.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cool, cool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *goal* for solving the problem is to create a [minimum spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) from the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several algorithms for accomplishing this. Two popular ones are:\n",
    "* [Prim's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm)\n",
    "* [Kruskal's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm), and\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a key phrase from the Wikipedia description of Kruskal's algorithm:\n",
    "> It's a greedy algorighm that in each step adds to the forest the lowest-weight edge that will not form a cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lines up with these sentences from the problem:\n",
    "> The next two junction boxes are 431,825,988 and 425,690,689. Because these two junction boxes were already in the same circuit, nothing happens!\n",
    "\n",
    "If an edge with two nodes that are already in a circut are added to that \"component\"/\"circut\", then that would introduce a cycle"
